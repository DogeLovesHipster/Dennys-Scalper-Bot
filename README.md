# Everyday Value Scalper Bot
# My attempt at getting a "The Everyday Value Tee" Scalper Bot

(This is a NEW public repo for my practice as I foolishly put my real address in my private repo of this project)

Back in November, I had the motivation to learn how every other person on the internet was able to snatch up limited-release items in mere seconds of the item hitting their website.

Though learning Javascript (which includes downloading everything to make it run) and learning the ropes of Puppeteer in just a week was not an easy task. My journey to accomplish this over a school break while everybody else was enjoying time away from school was going to be a humorous one.

So, with little guidance, I went on my journey and encountered every error known to man with nobody but myself to blame. I'll admit, I got quite far for doing this project on such short notice, but failed to completely automate it in a short time span.

Alas! I was vanquished by a simple link change as they added a simple "-1" to the end of their shirt's URL, which prevented my simple bot from accessing the shirt. Nowadays, I would have many methods to counter simple changes and even make my bot more effective at scalping items like this, but it mostly was just a period of time to get me more comfortable with code and a project that I thought up while bored over break.

I do not condone scalping, but I'm a broke college student who would have liked the benefit of eating free at a Denny's... So can you blame me? Probably. Thanks for reading!
